# Vallery

This is some self-taught 'messing-with-components' type work to learn more about actually structuring a Vue.js app. It doesn't actually implement the `vue-cli create` implementation, and uses **Parcel** instead of **Webpack**. I might be missing some stuff but for the most part, this is just suspposed to be a way to showcase simple one off web pages, mainly for some freeCodeCamp projects and JS30 stuff.

## How to Use the Vallery

Just navigate to `sampleset.json` and change all the informaation for it. The animations, images and components should update completely based on this, howwever make sure any fonts/assets youd like to change are supplied to the `.html` file.
