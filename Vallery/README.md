# Vallery

This is some self-taught 'messing-with-components' type work to learn more about actually structuring a Vue.js app. It doesn't actually implement the `vue-cli create` implementation, and uses **Parcel** instead of **Webpack**. I might be missing some stuff but for the most part, this is just suspposed to be a way to showcase simple one off web pages, mainly for some freeCodeCamp projects and JS30 stuff.

## How to Use the Vallery

Just navigate to `sampleset.json` and change all the informaation for it. The animations, images and components should update completely based on this, howwever make sure any fonts/assets youd like to change are supplied to the `.html` file.

The idea is that these `.html` files are a real pain to deploy with Netlify. Instead, I'll host all the SPAs on my **GitHub Pages** domain name. That way they can just be accessible with the correct URL even if it isn't nearly as pretty.

Then I will supply those links and resources as a dataset to the Vue Gallery (hence Vallery) which will create a showcase with an interactable iFrame so I can essentially deploy all similar projects to one context. 

On the actual Netlify site (`leander.xyz`), I'll have domains for `fcc`, `js30`, `learn-vue`, etc. These will be identical projects with different datasets passed to them hich will render this gallery page with resources overa at `leeandher.github.io`.
