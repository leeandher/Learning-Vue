<!-- # Vue School Fundamentals

This code goes along with a course offered by [VueSchool.io](https://vueschool.io) known as [Vue.js Fundamentals](https://vueschool.io/courses/vuejs-fundamentals). I may have made a few modifications to it along the way but alas, that is my nature. This is also my first step into the scary new world of `Vue.js` so if I'm not following _best practices_ it's probably because I don't know what the _best practices_ even smell like.

## How to Use Got2Do

Follow these steps to explore Got2Do

- Once cloned, just open `./Got2Do.html` and the app should load with some default items.

- You can toggle between the _edit_, and _default_ view using the **2Do?** and **2Done!** buttons respectively.
- To add a 2Do, switch to the _edit_ and click type in your description.
- Just stay inside the character limit, and when you're done, click `Add 2Do` or just press <kbd>Enter</kbd>. The 2Do list should update with your new item.
- You can click on it to mark it as _completed_, or click the `P` button to mark it as _priority_.
  - Got2Do is sorted priority first, then newest to oldest 2Dos.
- Since 2Do's are stored in `localStorage`, so keep that in mind if you plan on persisting sessions.
