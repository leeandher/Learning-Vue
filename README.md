# Learning-Vue

This repository contains a bunch of the small projects I've worked on while trying to learn Vue.js. There might not be a lot here at the moment, but the hope is that as I work on other small applications or utilities with vue, I can just toss them in here. Here's a catalog of what you'll find here:

- **Got2DO (Mar 26, 2019)** - [tutorial](https://vueschool.io/courses/vuejs-fundamentals)
  - A to-do application created as an introduction to Vue, all loaded into a simple webpage
  - You can add, prioritize, complete, and save the items on your to-do list
  - After-course features
    - priorities
    - date-time sorting
    - a character count maximum
    - persistance through `localStorage`
