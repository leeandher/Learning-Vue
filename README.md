# Vue-School-Fundamentals

This repository contains the code to go along with a course offered by [VueSchool.io](https://vueschool.io) known as [Vue.js Fundamentals](https://vueschool.io/courses/vuejs-fundamentals). I may have made a few modifications to it along the way but alas, that is my nature. This is also my first step into the scary new world of `Vue.js` so if I'm not following _best practices_ it's probably because I don't know what the _best practices_ even smell like.

I'm also going to be writing a few notes if I ever think something is important for me to have a reference to, so keep an eye out for that good stuff over at my [programming-notes repo](https://github.com/leeandher/programming-notes).

_This one is to all the real ones out there 🙏🙏😎😎_
